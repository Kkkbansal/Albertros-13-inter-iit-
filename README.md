# Albatross Energetics â€“ Cooling & Dehumidification System
This project presents an energy-efficient HVAC solution designed for Inter IIT Tech Meet 13.0 at IIT Bombay. We focused on optimizing refrigerant and compressor selection, designing efficient heat exchangers, and implementing a fuzzy PID-based control system to enhance performance and reduce power consumption.
